# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero.  The `BuggyDivision.java` file contains the erroneous code.  The `FixedDivision.java` file provides a solution by incorporating exception handling.

## How to Run

1. Save both Java files.
2. Compile using a Java compiler (like `javac`):
   ```bash
   javac BuggyDivision.java
   javac FixedDivision.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled code:
   ```bash
   java BuggyDivision
   java FixedDivision
   ```

Observe the different outputs and how the exception is handled in the corrected version.
